# vidl
Video/audio download site

# Website
The website source code is located in the website folder.
## Get started
- Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- `npm install`: install the dependencies.
- `npm run build-prod`: build the website. The output is located inside the `docs` folder, so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free.
- `npm run build-dev`: Just like the above, but for development. And it (Webpack) is watching for changes.
- In `config.js`, you'll find the websocket URLs that the website connects to, one for local development and one for production.
