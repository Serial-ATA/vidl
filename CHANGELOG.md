## 3.0.0 - 2018 Oct 4
Basically recreated vidl 2.0.0 in Python, with some added functionality.

## 2.0.0 - 2018 Sep 25
vidl 2.0 was a short-lived bash script. Very rough around the edges.

## 1.x.x: 2017 Oct 15
vidl 1.0 was a server, website and browser extension. You used the website or browser extension to submit a URL and format to the server, and eventually you got the final thing downloaded to yourself. By far the easiest-to-use solution, but I stopped it due to not wanting the server costs.
